# Cross-Runtime Delivery Model (DOC-03)

> Scope: this is the **DOC-03** cross-runtime guide — the single canonical home for *how* the
> contribution toolkit is delivered per runtime, *where* its enforcement actually applies, *why*
> slash-commands stay Claude-only (the CMD-01 finding), and the `off`-vs-`remove` lifecycle. It
> began as the focused RUN-01 delivery record (Phase 22) and has been folded into this fuller
> guide in Phase 24; the `install.sh` retirement (Phase 23) and the README polish (Phase 24,
> 24-02) are covered separately and are not re-described here.

## The one-paragraph truth

The contribution toolkit is delivered with a **per-runtime hybrid** model, not a single uniform
mechanism. On **Claude Code** the two skills are delivered by **symlink** (containment, edit-live,
byte-control) and the toolkit's **PreToolUse deny enforcement** is fully present. On **non-Claude
runtimes** (Codex, OpenCode, CodeBuddy, …) the same two skills are delivered by the **native
framework's third-party `skills[]` copy-convert** (dialect-translated copies), and **no
PreToolUse-deny surface exists** there, so the toolkit runs **advisory-only**. This is not a fork —
it is one capability projected two ways.

## Per-runtime matrix

| Layer | Claude | Non-Claude runtimes (Codex / OpenCode / others) |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills delivery** | **symlink** delivery — containment, edit-live, byte-control | **native third-party `skills[]` copy-convert** — dialect-translated copies |
| **PreToolUse enforcement** | **full** — gates can deny at the harness tool-call boundary | **none** — no PreToolUse-deny surface exists ⇒ **advisory-only** |

## Why symlink on Claude but copy-convert elsewhere (design §3)

Symlink delivery preserves containment and the **edit-live** workflow, but it is **only physically
possible where artifact conversion is identity** — i.e. the Claude Code runtime, where the canonical
artifact format *is* the runtime dialect, so the delivered file and the source file are the same
bytes. Other runtimes require the framework to **convert** each skill into that runtime's dialect.
That conversion mandates **copy-convert**: you cannot symlink a file that must be transformed — a
symlink would just point at the untranslated canonical bytes. So copy-convert is not a downgrade we
chose; it is the only mechanism that can deliver a *translated* artifact at all.

Consequence, stated plainly: **symlink edit-live is a Claude-only property.** On non-Claude runtimes
the delivered skill is a converted *copy*; editing the canonical source does not live-update the
already-converted copy the way a symlink would.

## Why enforcement is Claude-only (honesty framing)

PreToolUse **deny** enforcement is a **Claude Code harness feature** — the harness fires the hook
before the tool call (even under skip-permissions) and honors a deny decision. The gsd-core runtime
registry shows non-Claude runtimes have **no PreToolUse-deny surface** to fire into: Copilot has
"no hook events," OpenCode has "no lifecycle hook registration." Because the surface does not exist
on those runtimes, enforcement **cannot** exist there **regardless of delivery form** — converting
or symlinking the skill would not change that. On those runtimes the toolkit therefore runs
**advisory-only**: its guidance is advice, not a hard block.

This mirrors the manifest's existing honesty language: the deny property "belongs to those [Claude]
hooks," not to this capability. The capability itself is advisory; the harness hooks are the
enforcement layer, and that layer is Claude-only. The toolkit is never described as
unconditionally guaranteed against circumvention — enforcement is scoped to the Claude harness and
nothing more.

## What already exists vs. what is reused (Reuse-LIVE)

- **Claude symlink delivery already exists** (Phase 21): `deliverBundledSkills` /
  `removeBundledSkills` create directory symlinks resolving the runtime skills dir as
  `${CLAUDE_DIR:-~/.claude}/skills`. RUN-01 adds no new symlink code.
- **Cross-runtime skill delivery is the NATIVE framework's job.** Stock `gsd capability install`
  projects the bundle's declared **`skills[]`** contribution through the LIVE copy-convert /
  conversion pipeline into each runtime's dialect. This repo **reuses** that pipeline — it does
  **not** fork or reimplement copy-convert. RUN-01 adds **no new copy-convert code** in this repo
  (Reuse-LIVE).
- RUN-01's in-repo work is therefore **verify + document**: record this per-runtime model honestly,
  and prove (via `bin/skills-projection-shape.test.cjs`) that the bundle's `skills[]` is already
  shaped for native projection — every declared stem maps to a real bundle
  `skills/<stem>/SKILL.md`, so non-Claude skill delivery is reachable through the LIVE engine with
  no fork.

## Why slash-commands are Claude-only (CMD-01 finding)

The toolkit ships **5 agent-facing slash-commands** (`.md` files) and they stay **Claude-only**
this milestone. The reason is not an oversight — it is a structural gap in the capability framework
that CMD-01 set out to verify. The verified evidence (cited by location, not inlined):

- **ADR-959** (`gsd-core/docs/adr/959-capability-command-contribution.md`) — the accepted design
  for capability command contribution. It defines `commands[]` as a contribution of **first-party
  gsd-tools CLI subcommands**, each declared as a `{family, module, router}` entry: a `family`
  (the CLI command family name), a `module` (a `.cjs` module that implements it), and a `router`
  (the dispatch entrypoint). These are subcommands of the `gsd-tools` CLI — invoked through
  `gsd_run` / the opened `runCommand` entrypoint — **not** agent-facing slash-commands.
- **`gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-loader.cjs:697`** — the loader dispatches each declared command
  module as **executable CLI from the install root**, gated on a committed ledger entry. That
  dispatch path confirms `commands[]` is a **CLI command family**, not an agent slash-command
  overlay: the loader runs the module as a program, it does not register a `/command` an agent can
  type into a prompt.

**Consequence.** There is **no third-party slash-command overlay surface** in the capability
framework — no native way for a feature capability to contribute agent-facing `/commands`
cross-runtime. Because of that, the toolkit's 5 `.md` slash-commands stay **Claude-only via `.md`
symlink** (the existing Claude delivery), and there is deliberately **no `.md` → `.cjs` rewrite**.
Rewriting a prose slash-command into a `.cjs` command module would mis-shape an agent slash-command
into a CLI subcommand — a different surface with a different invocation model — so it is the wrong
fix, not a shortcut we skipped.

**Contrast with skills.** Skills do **not** have this gap: the framework has a native third-party
`skills[]` contribution, so the toolkit's 2 skills ship **cross-runtime** through the native
copy-convert pipeline (Phase 22). Slash-commands have no equivalent contribution surface, which is
exactly why they cannot follow the skills cross-runtime.

**Escalation.** Cross-runtime slash-command support is escalated to **UPS-01** as a captured
upstream feature request — a request for a third-party slash-command overlay surface so a feature
capability could contribute agent-facing slash-commands cross-runtime. See
`upstream-feature-requests.md` (captured, not filed this milestone).

## Lifecycle: `off` vs `remove`

The driver (`bin/contrib-capability.cjs`) is the single authority for delivery. Its subcommands are
`install | on | off | status | remove`. The two ways to deactivate the toolkit — `off` and `remove`
— differ in one decisive way: **`off` is re-activatable, `remove` is permanent.**

| Subcommand | Hooks (gates) | Commands | Skills | Enforcement flag | Ledger / consent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `install` | apply + enable | deliver (5) | deliver (2) | flag **on** | record |
| `on` | (re)apply | deliver | deliver | flag **on** | — |
| `off` | **strip** | **reclaim** | **reclaim** | flag **off** | **preserved** |
| `remove` | strip | reclaim | reclaim | flag off | **dropped + revoked** |

**`install` lands fully ON.** A first-time `install` records consent + the ledger, applies the
marker-tagged gates, delivers all 5 commands and both skills, and flips
`workflow.gsd_contrib_enforcement` to true. Nothing is left half-installed.

**`off` is a re-activatable disable.** It strips the marker-tagged gates from `settings.json`,
reclaims the delivered commands and skills (unlinking only the symlinks that point into our bundle —
never a real file or a foreign link), flips `workflow.gsd_contrib_enforcement` to false, and writes
an append-only accountability receipt. Crucially, it **preserves** the ledger, the project consent,
and the bundle — so a subsequent `on` restores every surface (gates + commands + skills + flag).
That clean **`off` → `on` round-trip** is the whole point of `off`: deactivate now, re-activate later
with nothing lost.

**`remove` is permanent teardown.** It strips the gates, reclaims both surfaces, **deletes the
ledger-owned files, revokes the project consent**, and writes a receipt. After `remove` there is no
re-activatable state to restore — re-enabling means a fresh `install`.

**Both deactivations are accountable and fail-closed.** Both `off` and `remove` require a non-empty
`--reason`, and both **probe that the receipt is append-writable before mutating anything**. If the
receipt cannot be written, the operation aborts and changes nothing — there is no un-logged disable.
Disabling the contrib guard is a deliberate, recorded act.

**Honesty note.** `off` and `remove` **genuinely remove the enforcement** — the gates *are* the
enforcement, and stripping them removes it for real (not a soft toggle that leaves a hidden block in
place). Enforcement exists only while the gates are installed on Claude Code; off-Claude it is
advisory-only regardless. The toolkit is not described as guaranteed against circumvention — its
enforcement is scoped to the Claude harness hooks while installed, and it is fully removable.
